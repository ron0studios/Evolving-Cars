> **Evolving (and building) cars using the genetic algorithm**

## Project brief
This is a simple project where you can set up your own race track, with hills, troughs and jumps. Upon creating a track, you can set certain parameters for the Genetic algorithm. 
These parameters will be explained in detail later in the text, but with them you can modify the aim of the AI, the speed of the simulation and more!

**Now watch as the AI learns to traverse the rough terrain you have set up for it!**

## Controls
**WASD** or **middle click and drag** to move around

**left click** to add new flooring

**Q** to zoom in, **E** to zoom out

## Parameters

**Start generation:** Starts the simulation

**Reset:** Stops the simulation

**Generation size:** Changes the size of each generation in each iteration of the algorithm *(may get laggy)*

**Genetic algorithm focuses:**

  - *Maximize distance:* focusing on how far the AI can go.
  - *Minimize volume:* focusing on how small the car body can be.
  - *Maximize wheels:* focusing on how big the wheels can be. 
  - *balanced:* Aims to make an AI that goes fast and has minimized wheels
  - *Maximize weight:* focusing on how heavy the car can be

**Zoom:** zooms in and out
**View best only:** If toggled, the best performing car will be highlighted whilst the rest will be barely visible.
**Max lifetime:** How long a car will be alive for before being destroyed. Adjust for bigger courses. *(MAY RESET THE COURSE IF CHANGED)*
**Time scale:** Changes the speed of the simulation *(PHYSICS CAN GET WHACKY AT HIGHER SPEEDS)*
